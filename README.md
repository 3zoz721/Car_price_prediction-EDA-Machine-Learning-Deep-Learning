# Car Price Prediction using EDA, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

This project aims to predict car prices using a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that includes *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), traditional **Machine Learning (ML)* models, and *Deep Learning (DL)* architectures.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains *16 features* related to car specifications and performance.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical columns.

## Technologies & Tools

- *Language:* Python  
- *Environment:* Jupyter Notebook  
- *Libraries:*  
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)  
  - Scikit-learn (for Machine Learning models)  
  - TensorFlow, Keras (for Deep Learning models)

## Models Used

### Machine Learning
- *Linear Regression*
- *Random Forest Regressor*

### Deep Learning
- *Sequential model* using Keras with:
  - Dense layers
  - Activation functions
  - Optimizers (e.g., Adam)

## Results

- Models were evaluated using standard regression metrics like *RÂ² Score*.
- Deep learning models achieved competitive results compared to traditional machine learning models.
